## Task: Implementing convolutional neural network in PyTorch

* Some of the images from the given dataset are displayed along with there true labels. For this images are denormalised and the dimension is permuted.
* Architecture of convolutional neural network is as follows :
    * 3 convolutional and pooling layers.
    * 3 fully connected layers.
    * Max-pooling is used.
    * **ReLu** activation function is mostly used except at last fully connected layer where activation function used is **softmax** as we are doing multiclass classification.
* Model was trained using crossEntropy loss function, Adam optimizer, and 40 epochs. Training accuracy obtained is 77%.
* Later, some of the images from validation dataset are displayed along woth their predicted labels.
